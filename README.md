-overall the website looks exactly like the figma. I was having trouble finding what to improve on. I noticed the search button only works when you click the search icon. maybe you could implement a way to where you can use the enter button instead. Also when you enter an invalid place there is no on screen messege saying that it was invalid. This might be confusing to users so you should make a popup saying the input was invalid. You could create your own or you can use an alert. Lastly on load it takes your geolocation and displays the data. However the current location doesnt update. Its like that on the figma however  this is kinda confusing.
